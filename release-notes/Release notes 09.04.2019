3. **New Payment Instruction*
Due to specifics of ASIC protocols sometimes an invoice may not be delivered to NowInfinity’s software.  NowInfinity has developed a new automatic Payment Instruction that extracts and compares previous and current debt for active companies on the platform.
The new Payment Instruction enables NowInfinity to report the difference for outstanding payments. This new option will calculate the debt difference owing to ASIC and administers an invoice that will reflect the new debt to the company. Members will be provided with a Payment Instruction notice to indicate that an “increase in debt” has been identified. The instruction will be sent to the company’s account manager.
