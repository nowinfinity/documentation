#Release notes 10 July 2017:
- Introducing Pins! 
You will now find 'pins' have been added to your Companies page in Corporate Messenger. You can use these pins to further organise and distinguish between family groupings, prioritisation and delegation of companies and associations, no matter how broad or specific! Currently, there are two types of pins; permanent and system generated.
Permanent: These are pins created by you. You can only remove these pins manually once they have been added to relavant companies. To add a new pin, simply navigate to 'Companies' page in Corporate Messenger and click on the pin icon on the far right hand side. You can select an existing pin to apply or you can create a new pin and select colour coding. To remove a permanent pin, simply select that pin and click on the edit button which appears on the far right hand side. 
System Generated: These are created automatically by the platform and will be added to the relevant companies automatically. Pins will be created for events such as: Debt, Credit, Burning AS, Late Fees, Awaiting Change and Charity Organisations.
