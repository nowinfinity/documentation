#Release notes 20.12.2017:
1. Automatic text message reminders now available – You now have the ability to customise, schedule and send automatic text reminders to clients. This can be setup via the reminders page under CM settings. 

2. New feature for merging 480F Form – This new feature will allow you to present clients with an up to date document. There are a number of reasons you may want to do this including to cater for situations were the Annual Statement has been delivered to a pre-existing ASIC agent and falls outside of the re-issuring deadling from ASIC or there has been ad admin error and you need to override the data in the Annual Statement in order to present clients with an up to date document. 

3. NEW DOCUMENTS – Capital Reserved Lineal Descendant & Full Reserved Lineal Descendant 

4. NEW DOCUMENT - Change of Reversionary Status under ‘Pensions’
